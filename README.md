**Hi there!👋**

**I’m Stalin - an IT engineer who loves tinkering, learning, and sharing what I discover with others.**

Here, you’ll find the fun stuff I do in my homelab - experiments, setups, and lessons that go beyond home servers to tackle real-world IT challenges. This space is my playground for exploring cool tools across the DevOps ecosystem. From networking and code to security and automation, I like showing how smart tech can make life easier and privacy stronger.

## **🔧 What drives me?** 

I get a real kick out of **troubleshooting**. There’s something deeply satisfying about digging into messy systems, breaking them apart, and putting them back together better than before. Whether it’s debugging a complex system or refining a deployment pipeline, I enjoy figuring out what went wrong - and more importantly, how to prevent it next time.

## **💡 Why I do this?** 

I live by a quote that perfectly sums up my motivation:
> **“When one teaches, two learn.” — Robert Heinlein**

I genuinely enjoy learning and tinkering, but I also believe that sharing what you learn is what truly helps it stick. Giving back to the community makes the whole process more meaningful - and honestly, more fun.

## **🌐 Where you’ll find my work**

Check out my [Website](https://stalin.thetinkerer.dev) - that’s where I post hands-on tutorials and write-ups aimed at making complex topics simple and approachable.

## **🚀 Join the journey**

I’ll be sharing new projects, practical how-tos, and ways to get more from your tech setup. Whether you’re just getting started or deep into DevOps, you’ll find ideas and insights to sharpen your skills.
Let’s **tinker**, **learn**, and **build** together - and make technology work for us in smarter, more creative ways.
