# Stalin Stepin

**Hi there!👋**

**I’m Stalin - an IT engineer who loves tinkering, learning, and sharing what I discover with others.**

Here, you’ll find the fun stuff I do in my homelab - experiments, setups, and lessons that go beyond home servers to tackle real-world IT challenges. This space is my playground for exploring cool tools across the DevOps ecosystem. From networking and code to security and automation, I like showing how smart tech can make life easier and privacy stronger.

## **🔧 What drives me?** 

I get a real kick out of **troubleshooting**. There’s something deeply satisfying about digging into messy systems, breaking them apart, and putting them back together better than before. Whether it’s debugging a complex system or refining a deployment pipeline, I enjoy figuring out what went wrong - and more importantly, how to prevent it next time.

## **💡 Why I do this?** 

I live by a quote that perfectly sums up my motivation:
> “When one teaches, two learn.” — Robert Heinlein

I genuinely enjoy learning and tinkering, but I also believe that sharing what you learn is what truly helps it stick. Giving back to the community makes the whole process more meaningful - and honestly, more fun.

## **🌐 Where you’ll find my work**

Check out my [Website](https://stalin.thetinkerer.dev) - that’s where I post hands-on tutorials and write-ups aimed at making complex topics simple and approachable.

## **🚀 Join the journey**

I’ll be sharing new projects, practical how-tos, and ways to get more from your tech setup. Whether you’re just getting started or deep into DevOps, you’ll find ideas and insights to sharpen your skills.
Let’s tinker, learn, and build together — and make technology work for us in smarter, more creative ways.
